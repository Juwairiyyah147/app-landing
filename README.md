## Design Choices and Libraries Used

### Design Choices

- **Component-based Architecture**: The application is built with a component-based architecture, making it modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices.
- **SCSS for Styling**: Each component has its own SCSS file, with all styles referenced in `Main.scss`, allowing for scoped and maintainable styles.

### Libraries and Tools Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, chosen for its component-based architecture and state management capabilities.
- **SCSS**: Used for styling components, providing nested rules, variables, and mixins which make CSS more maintainable.
- **PostCSS**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins, used to compile Tailwind CSS.
